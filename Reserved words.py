Assert

#The assert keyword is used when debugging code.
#The assert keyword lets you test if a condition in your code returns True, if not, the program will raise an AssertionError.
#You can write a message to be written if the code returns False, check the example below.


Nonlocal

#The nonlocal keyword is used to work with variables inside nested functions, where the variable should not belong to the inner function.
#Use the keyword nonlocal to declare that the variable is not local.
